1)lay out the rest of traces
2)ensure traces on right side of white line are 50% larger
3)reduce size of board (connector on right side can hang over a bit as long as mounted on board)
4)either erase or make redudent name invisible
5)either erase or make abitrary compnent numbers from schematic invisible

*note* board looks....interesting with current gnd and 5v plane.
can extend to entire board for aethsetic purposes, but is only needed on left side of 
white line.
